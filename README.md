# Symbolic-Regression
This is an experiment that implements symbolic regression.

This project explores the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in symbolic regression, with a focus on three distinct data sets. The datasets vary in complexity, from single-variable datasets to those featuring multivariate,  trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions. In three distinct datasets, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) were employed for symbolic regression with different data engineering techniques and hyperparameters. The results demonstrated that the GA-based approach successfully discovered accurate mathematical expressions for each dataset, while the convergence rate for each varies.
